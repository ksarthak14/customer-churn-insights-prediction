# Customer Churn Insights & Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning and analytics project designed to identify customers at high risk of churn in the telecommunications sector. The system combines predictive modeling, database integration, and interactive dashboards to support data-driven retention strategies.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn directly impacts revenue and profitability. This project addresses the lack of a structured, data-driven mechanism to predict churn and identify vulnerable customer segments before they leave.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- MySQL
- Power BI
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- Logistic Regression model with feature scaling and encoding
- Churn probability and binary risk prediction
- MySQL integration for prediction storage
- Batch and single-customer prediction support
- Interactive Power BI dashboards (Executive, Behaviour, Model Insights)

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: ~80%
- Precision: ~66%
- Recall: ~56%
- F1-Score: ~61%
- ROC-AUC: ~84%

## Project Structure
Refer to the folder layout for data, notebooks, source code, SQL schema, model artifacts, and dashboard screenshots.

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time churn prediction
- Advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- CRM integration
- Explainable AI (XAI)
